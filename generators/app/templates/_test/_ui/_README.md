# Unit Testing

A simple setup has been provided using mocha-webpack and jsdom. Use

`npm run watch-test`

Some points to note are

## Webpack

Webpack is set up to resolve imported dependencies from _test/ui/node_modules_. So if you are testing a component from _src/ui_ (and that component in turn imports a non-relative module) you will need to

* add the same module to the package.json file in _test/ui_ __or__
* add an _alias_ in webpack.config.js that resolves to _src/ui/node_modules/&lt;alias&gt;_ __&amp;__ then _whitelist the alias_ so it is included in the actual bundle

## Events

When writing unit tests to simulate user interaction with the browser, you will modify DOM elements of the component via code. After making changes you will often need to _manually trigger HTML events_.

This will trigger Vue to make an async update to the underlying virtual DOM.

After this update you can then make assertions by accessing [vm.$el](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-el). See the official documentation on [vm.$nextTick([callback])](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-nextTick) for details
